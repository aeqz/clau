# Clau

A minimalistic password store or, as a friend properly pointed out, just an encrypted CRUD.

The encryption mechanism is explained in [this module](./assets/typescript/crypto.ts) comments.

## Development

Requires `Node.js` to be installed. Then:

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm i

# Run development server with debugger and hot reload
npm run dev

# Generate static assets in the dist directory
npm run build
```
